Summary: What it is, why it's important, and how to achieve it.

Database normalization is a process in database design that aims to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. Normalization involves dividing a database into two or more tables and defining relationships between the tables. The goal of normalization is to minimize data redundancy and ensure data is stored in a consistent, organized manner.

There are several normalization levels, or normal forms, that are commonly used, including:

- **First Normal Form (1NF)**: In 1NF, each table in a database must have a unique primary key and each column in the table must contain only atomic values, which are indivisible values that cannot be further divided.
- **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: In 2NF, a table must be in 1NF and all non-key attributes must be dependent on the primary key. This means that there should be no redundant data in the table.
- **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: In 3NF, a table must be in 2NF and all transitive dependencies between non-key attributes must be removed. Transitive dependencies occur when changes to one non-key attribute can affect another non-key attribute.
- **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**: In BCNF, a table must be in 3NF and all non-trivial functional dependencies between the primary key and non-key attributes must be removed.
- **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)** and **higher normal forms**: 4NF and higher normal forms are advanced normalization levels that are less commonly used and are used in specific situations where data redundancy and integrity is of particular concern.

Achieving normalization is important for several reasons, including:

- **Data consistency**: Normalization helps to ensure that data is stored in a consistent and organized manner, which reduces the risk of data inconsistency and data corruption.
- **Improved data integrity**: Normalization helps to ensure that data is stored in a way that minimizes data redundancy and reduces the risk of data integrity issues, such as data loss and data anomalies.
- **Better data retrieval performance**: Normalized databases tend to perform better than non-normalized databases, especially when it comes to data retrieval operations, as they are less prone to data redundancy and data inconsistencies.

In conclusion, database normalization is a process in database design that aims to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. Normalization involves dividing a database into two or more tables and defining relationships between the tables. Achieving normalization is important for ensuring data consistency, improving data integrity, and better data retrieval performance.
